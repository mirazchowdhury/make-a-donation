        <h1><br>Support Victims of Bangladesh's</br> Deadly Floods</h1>
        <p>South Asia is used to downpours, and occasional floods, during monsoon season. But this yearâ€™s flooding
            has
            been
            extreme, especially in Bangladesh.Many victims of natural disaster find themselves left out of the
            recovery
            often relying on the generosity of others to bounce back. Nonprofits and others provide assistance, but
            the
            process is difficult to navigate. Right after a natural disaster,there is usually an outpouring of
            generosity
            and support for those affected, often in the form of material needs. But a few weeks into the recovery
            effort,
            that support and all the donated goods that poured in dwindle.As soon as you complete your donation,
            your
            gift
            will start its journey.</p>
